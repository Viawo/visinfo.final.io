            <p class="pertitle">Designing:</p> 
            <p class="p1para">First, most of this design was determined by the many limitations and restrictions occurring during the coding process, however, I utilized what I could to visualize the dataset as concise but informative as possible with these issues.  Such these problems were consistently adding numerical axes therefore I went with a percentage bar chart due to the visual reliance on which bar is higher but also the distance between the bars was useful in grouping them when adding more than 3 elements, for example, the home page graphs are limited to category and subcategory (So Sex -than female/male), but the other pages include 1 additional element, which both color and bar distance was applied to emphasize their grouping and contrast. Category titles for each graph were kept to a minimum and abbreviations were used to take as less space as possible but also keep things clean. The page format focuses on keeping content towards the center for visual ease/focus which affected data & text placement. The Navigation bar text color is different from the rest of each page to draw attention and get clicks to other pages, navbar is implemented to focus data on the same center rather than all graphs on a singular page, which would also distract from the focus of each 3rd applied element (sex & family size) and draw away their emphasis). Doc Page is as straightforward as possible with no distraction and focuses on text due to center alignment. </p>

            <p class="pertitle">Explanation:</p> 
            <p class="p1para">Many other elements were attempted to be added, but coding proved too tedious. Out of place, and distracting to integrate successfully. I chose sex, school, address, family size, and parent cohabitation because they visualized multiple patterns. The other elements not added would provide deeper analysis but came with too many specifications to implement.  I exported the dataset to excel, and the chosen elements had some interesting patterns. The general percentages were available on the dataset page, but the by sex & by family size graphs were calculated via excel and recounting. First, the two strongest (sub)attributes that determine the likelihood of more consumption of alcohol were parents living together of the parents’ cohabitation attribute and Gabriel of school attribute, which could go into an analysis regarding school culture and parenting but that’s a tangent. To explore how strong these attributes were, I applied 2 different third attributes (sex and family size) to each graph to see what the results would be, Sex specifically because it was the most balanced bar graph and family size which was the second most balanced though it is still more off-balanced. What I found out was even with the inclusion of sex and family size, those strong attributes were most of the higher bars and inversely, the sub-attributes that followed the weakest rates of consumption were rural address and parents apart. So, the final answer to the question is the male is the most likely to consume alcohol than the female in that situation.</p>
